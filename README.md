# Mandelbrot set visualization in WebGL
[Demo website](https://larqqa.github.io/mandelbrot-visualization/)

## What is this?
This is my interpretation of a Mandelbrot set visualization.
I used WebGL to plot the Set. The App itself can visualize the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set in a HSV colour scheme.

## How to use?

`npm install` to install the necessary packages

`npm start` to start the workflow, use

`npm run build` makes a production build of the project

`npm run serve` serves the production folder located in `dist`

`npm run lint`  to lint your JavaScript
